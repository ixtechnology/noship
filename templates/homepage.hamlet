        About
    <p>
        Ix Technology is a general cybernetics firm. In an age
        of complex and dynamic networks, we specialize in
        interaction. How will a customer actually use your website?
        How can we most effectively organize machines to achieve
        our aims? Our firm is founded on the idea that the future
        belongs to the generalist. This principle has us going from
        web development and marketing to research &
        engineering â€” cross-pollinating as we go.
    <p>
        Ix Technology is available for outside contracting. Your
        business hires our expertise, and we'll build you a custom
        solution that reduces overhead & technical worries. Feel
