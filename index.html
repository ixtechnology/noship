      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        We are currently working on three experimental projects:
        <a href='https://github.com/ixtechnology/prc'>
        pervasively reconfigurable computing</a>,
        <a href='https://github.com/ixtechnology/cots'>
        zz-structured data applications</a>, 
        and our robust open-source laptop:
        <a href='https://github.com/ixtechnology/cots'>COTS MBC</a>.
        These projects draw on influences from artificial intelligence
        research to paraconsistent logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our firm is also in the business of developing merchantable
        applications. Specifically, we're focused on the web.
        Functional programming furnishes us with excellent tools
        for this task, allowing us to build reliable, robust, scalable,
        and high-uptime software targeting myriad devices.
